* [snaql-migration](https://github.com/komissarex/snaql-migration)

> Lightweight SQL schema migration tool, based on Snaql query builder.
> The main idea is to provide ability of describing migrations in raw SQL â€“ every migration is a couple of files: 001-some-migration.apply.sql and 001-some-migration.revert.sql
> Suitable for both Python 2.7 and 3.3+
